Data Policies are interesting in that they truly stop things from happening.

## What is a Data Policy?

Data policies let you configure conditions on a table and related fields that are required or read-only.  When anything tries to change those fields, the data policy is checked and the change is either allowed or denied regardless how you do it.  

## When to use a Data Policy?

Data policies are great for enforcing specific details and there's even an option to run it as a UI Policy in addition to the server side check.
